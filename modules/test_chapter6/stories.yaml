        text: "The Woodmen examine the scroll with grave concern. Waulfa looks up from the parchment, his weathered face showing rare alarm. 'Skauril marches against the Elves. We must warn Thranduil, but his warriors are scattered. Someone must slow this army, or many Elves will die.'"

        text: "The Witch-king has sent Skauril three duplicate scrolls ordering an assault on Thranduil's Elves. The scroll reads:\n\n'Skauril—My forces raid in Arthedain, keeping the eyes of the foolish Elf-friends facing my kingdom. Now must you assault Aradhrynd. Hasten. Although Thranduil's house guard numbers less than 200, he will assemble more warriors if you delay too long. Leave no later than two days past the full moon. —Good Blood, Angmar'\n\nThe attacks in Arthedain are meant to distract the Wise while Skauril attacks the Elves. A victory would greatly lengthen the shadows of Mirkwood."

        text: "Bulkupar's map shows the location of Skauril's caverns (starting point). The Elves' house guard numbers only 100—not enough to defend outlying settlements. Skauril cannot penetrate Aradhrynd fortress, but hopes to destroy many Elves in the surrounding area.\n\nWaulfa can send 30 Woodmen troops, but they will barely arrive in time. For each day Skauril is delayed, the Elves can muster more warriors."

Waulfa nods gravely. 'If someone could slow the army, track its numbers, or demoralize its troops, the Elves would have time to gather their strength.'"

One line marks the path Skauril must use to move a large force. Unknown: how Skauril plans to cross the enchanted river Gulduin."

The family struggled—Gardagd hunted in Mirkwood to add meat to the table.\n\nReturning from one hunt, he saw smoke rising from his home. He found smoldering ruins: father dead, mother and sisters carried off by Easterlings.\n\nCursing Easterlings, Gondorians, and the world, he returned to the forest. He learned that Men were easier prey than beasts—their silver bought food and supplies. He became a bandit.\n\nOnce he tried to rob an agent of Skauril (attracted by a fat purse) and was brought before the Conjurer. Skauril saw potential and enrolled him as a scout/assassin.\n\nGardagd secretly hates Easterlings and will kill Skauril if given an easy opportunity."

TRAPS:\n- After 3+ successful traps, Skauril sends Scouts ahead to detect more\n- Cuts movement by 1/2 mile per day\n- Scouts traveling quickly: -20 to Trap Detection\n\n3. INFILTRATION:\n- Change of Kind spells may allow penetration\n- If detected: Skauril increases night patrols by 10% (up to 3 times)\n- Then Rangers/Animists use Nature's Awareness for night watch\n- Plant Facade or Invisibility: Watch army pass, report organization\n- Long Ear: Learn Skauril's plans\n\n4. RAIDS:\n- After 3 losses to main force (snipers/raids), Skauril uses magic to locate and attack with overwhelming force\n- By this point, close to Gulduin—discretion recommended\n- Flee to give information to Elves"

When little more than a toddler, his parents and brother were killed by goblins. His sister escaped with baby brother Grimbold. Killing Orcs is his personal Quest. A mercenary who will be fair about dividing treasure but is fond of money and wants his share. Uses almost all weapons with equal skill."

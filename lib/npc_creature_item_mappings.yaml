# =============================================================================
# THIEF VS ROGUE
# =============================================================================
# Note: Both "Thief" and "Rogue" exist as separate templates in Character Law.
# By default, we map generic "Thief" requests to "Rogue" which is the more
# modern/neutral term. If user specifically wants the Character Law "Thief"
# template, they should specify it exactly.
#
# Mapping: Generic "thief" → "Rogue" template
# Exact match: "Thief" (when specified exactly) → "Thief" template

# =============================================================================
# LEVEL DEFAULTS
# =============================================================================
# When a user doesn't specify a level for leveled NPCs/creatures:
#
# DEFAULT_LEVEL: 4
#
# Reasoning: Most "Ready Adventures" are designed for characters at levels 4-6,
# so level 4 is a reasonable default for NPCs.
#
# This applies to:
# - All profession-based NPCs (Fighter, Ranger, Rogue, Spell Users, etc.)
# - Any named NPC based on a profession template
#
# Does NOT apply to:
# - Fixed-stat creatures (Wolf, Orc, Troll - use their standard stats)
# - Items (items don't have levels)

# =============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# =============================================================================
# 
# Matching Priority:
# 1. Exact match in library (case-insensitive)
# 2. Check this mapping file
# 3. Fuzzy match (edit distance < 3 or 80%+ similarity)
# 4. Report not found
#
# Example YAML usage:
#
# encounters:
#   - name: "Forest Patrol"
#     npcs:
#       - name: "Scout"           # Maps to Ranger, uses level 4
#         count: 2
#       
#       - name: "Warrior"         # Maps to Fighter, uses level 4
#         level: 6                # Override default level
#         count: 3
#       
#       - name: "Wolf"            # Exact match, fixed stats
#         count: 5
#       
#       - name: "Skauril"         # Named NPC
#         based_on: "Warrior"     # Maps to Fighter
#         level: 15
#         modifications:
#           hits: 150
#
# =============================================================================
# FUZZY MATCHING EXAMPLES
# =============================================================================
#
# These would match with fuzzy matching (edit distance ≤ 2):
# - "Brodsword" → "Broadsword"
# - "Wolfs" → "Wolf"
# - "Rangr" → "Ranger"
#
# These would NOT match (too different):
# - "Bird" → "Broadsword" (edit distance too high)
# - "Cat" → "Rat" (could match, but semantically wrong)
#
# Fuzzy matching should be used carefully and may require user confirmation
# in an interactive tool.

# =============================================================================
# MAINTENANCE NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# When adding new mappings:
# 1. Check if the target exists in the library
# 2. Document reasoning for non-obvious mappings
# 3. Consider if multiple mappings make sense (e.g., "Assassin" could be
#    Rogue or a specific custom NPC)
# 4. Test edge cases (capitalization, plurals, etc.)
#
# To validate this file:
# 1. Load both NPC and Item libraries
# 2. For each mapping, verify target exists
# 3. Report any broken mappings
